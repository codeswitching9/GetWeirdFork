# Get Weird - a supernatural sighting web application

## Update
This is the capstone project that I completed at the end of my LaunchCode program. Additional project files and changes from 4/14/2023 onward are my own.

## Description
Are you someone who loves watching horror movies?

Have you ever wanted to visit someplace haunted in real life?

If you're someone who seeks the bizarre or supernatural, this is the site for you! It's a simple-to-use guide to finding supernatural spots around the United States. 

Users who create accounts can search for supernatural hotspots, save their favorites, and leave ratings and reviews about their experiences in those locations. You can even assign your saved places to a folder to make planning specific trips easy. 

Read reviews from other users to determine if a location is worth looking into. From ghosts to aliens to cryptids... it has never been easier to find your new favorite haunt!
